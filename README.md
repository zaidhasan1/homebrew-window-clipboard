# Window Clipboard

Window Clipboard is a simple, efficient clipboard history tool designed specifically for developers and power users on macOS. It runs quietly in the background, keeping track of your copied text and files, and allows you to easily paste them back with a global shortcut.

## Features

- **Clipboard History**: Automatically saves your copied text and file paths.
- **Global Shortcut**: Press `Cmd + Shift + V` to open the history window from anywhere.
- **Files Support**: Tracks copied files and allows you to copy/paste them again.
- **Smart Pasting**: Automatically pastes the selected item into your active application (macOS optimized).
- **Pinning**: Pin important items to keep them at the top of your history and prevent meaningful clips from being autodeleted.
- **Stealth Mode**: Runs purely in the menu bar (system tray) without cluttering your Dock.
- **Persistence**: Your history is saved locally and persists across restarts.
- **Tray Access**: Quick access to history, settings, and more from the menu bar icon.

## Supported Platforms

- **macOS**: Optimized for macOS 10.15 (Catalina) and later.
  - Supports Intel and Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) macs.

## Usage

1. **Copy** anything (text or files) as you normally would (`Cmd + C`).
2. Press **`Cmd + Shift + V`** to open the clipboard history overlay.
3. **Select** an item from the list:
   - Click to copy and paste immediately.
   - Use the **Pin** icon to save an item indefinitely.
   - Use the **Delete** icon to remove an item.
4. The window automatically hides when you switch focus or select an item.

## Privacy

All clipboard data is stored locally on your machine in your user directory (`~/Library/Application Support/window-clipboard`). No data is ever sent to the cloud.
